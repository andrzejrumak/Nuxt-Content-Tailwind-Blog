<h2> The empty tomb. </h2>

How good it was that the Father did not leave the Son in the grave, He revived Him and took Him to Himself.

All hell was already rejoicing because the Son of God had been crucified and laid in the tomb. But the Father was not indifferent; He raised Him from the dead.

Jesus Christ is alive, triumphant, victorious, invincible - the tomb is empty.

When it seems that your child is already at a loss, do not give up, do not be indifferent, but support him with all your might.

I wish all fathers at Christmas time, but also every day, victory with the greatest struggles in their fatherhood.
