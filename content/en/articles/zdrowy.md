## A child's need for a dad.

There are children who do not know their dad or poorly because he died prematurely. The child becomes an orphan and experiences this absence for the rest of his life. It is a tragedy. An even greater tragedy is when the father dies "at his own wish," through his neglect, through his sick lifestyle.

Fathers try and use a lot of their time to provide their child with a good life, a better start, forgetting that they are the best investment, support and value in his life. No material goods can replace the relationship with your own father. For a child it is more important that you are with him, that you talk to him, that you support him, that you build his character and future, than millions of gifts from which he grows up and leaves an emptiness and chase for the new.

## What Takes A Dad Away.

Constantly being away from home, constantly busy, constantly tired you take yourself away from the child who needs you. Living in constant stress, you can't respond calmly to his need to be with you. If you go abroad to earn money, you exclude yourself from your child's life. By falling into addictions you take away his happy childhood. Finally, if you get sick and leave the world, you ruin the child's life, which has a negative impact even on his or her adult life.

## Be healthy for your child

A healthy lifestyle will pay off for you and your child. I am not an expert in this field but there are many guides and materials on how to lead a healthy lifestyle. Definitely exercise, definitely eat right. It's important to stop poisoning your body and your baby's daddy with cigarettes and alcohol. Lower your stress and get a good night's sleep.

Fight for yourself for your children and maybe for your grandchildren.
