<h2> An Animal in the family. </h2>

A month ago she appeared. Daisy is a mix between a poodle and a Maltese.
Before we had two mongrel dogs, which we had to give away due to children's illnesses. Two children grew up and there was no sign of illnesses. Now our youngest needed a companion, someone to take care of and become responsible for. It had been a great dream of my wife to have a dog since she was a child.

We have Daisy for over a month. She travelled with us already over 2 thousand kilometers. She is smart and has her own character. For now she is a baby and there is a lot of trouble with her. I hope that everything will stabilize.
There are of course pros and cons of owning a dog. They are briefly presented by Mrs. Anna on [psy24.pl](https://psy24.pl/psy-i-ludzie,ac104/mam-psa-plusy-i-minusy-posiadania-psa,355 'I have a dog: Pros and cons of owning a dog').

Is it worth it? For sure it is not always comfortable but you dads have to decide if you want to have another creature in your home. Unfortunately there is no 500+ for a dog :-).
