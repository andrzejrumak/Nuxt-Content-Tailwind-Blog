<h2>Starting a Blog - I'm a Father </h2>
<h3> Welcome fathers, dads. </h3>
Today is a special day in my family so I am spontaneously starting a website to celebrate.
My two adult children have graduated from college and defended their thesis. They have long since entered their adult life and are already independent but still need support. My youngest son still needs a lot of attention to grow up to be as independent and smart as the two older ones. So I have learned a lot when it comes to being a dad and a father, but I also have many challenges ahead of me. These are all things I want to write about and maybe some of you will benefit. Of course I will also be developing the blog page, which at the moment is a minimal version of what is in the plan. More articles coming soon.
