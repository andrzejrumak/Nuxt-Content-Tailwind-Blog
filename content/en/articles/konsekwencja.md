<h2> Consistency </h2>

Once we set a direction, we set a goal, it is very important to be consistent in achieving it. Everyday persistence to go step by step in the chosen direction.

Our youngest son would never go to swimming competitions if he did not learn to swim because of our and his teachers' lack of consistency.

Consistency is doing something we plan, say, promise. We are also then credible, trustworthy in front of the child and then the child knows that he cannot manipulate us. We become a natural authority for them because our words are reflected in practice. Then they feel safe because they know what to expect. They themselves, having such an example, become obedient and truthful.

When I go out for a walk with our doggie this puppy tries everything he encounters on the road. It's dangerous because people throw everything on the sidewalk, the lawn, everywhere. If I hadn't persistently dragged Daisy away from the pet, plastic and foil and constantly told her to leave it, she could have died a long time ago. How many times do we have to tell our children that it is forbidden to do this or that. Let's keep it that way to protect them. The dog grows and slowly the garbage on her way become indifferent, because she knows that always after coming back there is a bowl with good food waiting for her. Consistency is not easy, it requires patience, sometimes self-denial but it pays off in the lives of older children.

Also important in this topic is what we actually persist with. Direction is important. I don't need to explain that, for example, consistent, daily abuse of alcohol is just an addiction leading to family tragedies and early death. It is necessary to wisely promise, teach, prohibit to then consistently fulfill, train, enforce.

Without consistency we will get nowhere and we will just go around in circles and only be left with our unfulfilled dreams. When our goals are foolish and we are stubborn we and our children will end badly.

One more thing. If there are two directions in the family, one set by dad and one by mom, we won't get anywhere and the consistency of both parents will lead to a split ego of the child. So let's be unanimous with the child and let's agree on the goals, rules and direction together in advance in order to stick to one version. Otherwise the child will try to manipulate us and will not achieve anything good.

So I wish you wisdom and consistency dads.
