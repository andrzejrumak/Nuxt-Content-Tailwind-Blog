# The greatest love

We know the sentence that is written on the graves of the dead to warn of the passing of time and to encourage us to make good use of it.

> Let's hurry to love people... for they are gone so soon...

For fathers, that sentence would sound like this:

> Let's hurry to love our children... because they grow up so fast...

What does it mean?
The answer to this important question soon ...
