<h2> Direction of Life </h2>

Over the course of a lifetime, a person is faced with many more or less choices every day. It is difficult for us as fathers to decide on every choice for our child. It is not realistic. But it is very important to help set the child in the right direction in life.

I have learned that as parents we can't protect our children from all the wrong decisions. We can, however, through a close relationship with them, talk and teach the child to draw conclusions, lessons even from the wrong decisions. We can teach to set good goals, cheer and support our children on the way to achieving these goals. Our own example is especially valuable.

Early on, we choose for our children the nursery, the elementary school, the extracurricular activities. We do it with wisdom, based on the observation of the child's abilities, likes, dreams, and already then we direct their future life. Later, when they grow up, we make key decisions such as high school and college together with our children. However there comes a moment in the life of our adult children when they have to responsibly choose their own life partner, job or place of residence - and then we should also be open to being an advisor and support.

Daddy - from your child's earliest years you are responsible for the direction his life will take. What direction are you setting for him?
