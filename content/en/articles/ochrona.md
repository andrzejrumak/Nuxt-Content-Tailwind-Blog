## Protect

Yesterday I came across a shocking work of art by an artist. I give a link to the work below because I don't want to post it here because it's not about the work, which everyone can comment on in different ways, but about my thoughts.

[LOS INTOCABLES - THE UNTOUCHABLES](https://vimeo.com/81485559 'LOS INTOCABLES - THE UNTOUCHABLES').

Six very cruel zones in which children suffer are depicted in this work, " The Untouchables".

Children suffer cruelly during wars, which bring suffering and the loss of loved ones. Sometimes they are sexually abused by so-called "authorities". They lose their lives by becoming organ donors. They are indirect victims of the food industry and other business manipulations.

These dangers seem distant to us, but they are real.

There are also nearer, everyday dangers. Today, because of the pandemic, a lot is happening online. School, competition, and friendly contacts happen in the virtual world. This world can also be cruel and full of threats.

Our children are exposed to hegemony, game addiction, pornography, pedophilia. They sit in front of the screen all day and are they able to protect themselves and not suffer psychological damage and injuries that will affect their adulthood. I have two adult children and I think they have emerged victorious from many skirmishes. The virtual world was not as pervasive as it is today when my teenager faces the dangers it poses.

Dads, be their defenders so that they can emerge victorious from this battle. Take an interest in their virtual struggles and face them together.

Just be with them and do not abandon your children, turning a blind eye to the massive attacks, but teach them to use new technologies well.

I wish you perseverance in the fight
